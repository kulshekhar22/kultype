Group: Let G be a non-empty set and * be a binary operation on G, then the algebraic structure (G, * ) is called a group if the following axioms are satisfied:
1. Closure: 
2. Associativity:
3. Existence of identity element:
4. Existence of inverse: 

Order of a group: Let (G, * ) be a group, then number of elements in G is called order of G
Order of an element: Let (G, * ) be a group and a be an element of G, then order of a is a least positive integer n such that $a^n = e$
