Coulomb's Law states that
	1. Electric [[Force]] ($\vec{F(\vec{r})}$) of attraction or repulsion([[Electrostatics]]) between charges is directly proportional to the product of charge.
	2. Force ($\vec{F(\vec{r})}$) between charges is inversely proportional to the square of distance between them.
	3. Direction of force is always along line joining between the charges



Hence Mathematical formula for Electric force between charges $Q_1~and~Q_2$ which is placed in vacuum at a distance $r$ is given by $$\vec{F(\vec{r})}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q_1Q_2}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r^{'}}|^{3}}(\vec{r}-\vec{r^{'}})$$
Where $Q_1$ is at $\vec{r^{'}}$ ([[Position Vector]] of $Q_1$)
	and $Q_2$ is at $\vec{r}$  (Position Vector of $Q_2$)
	Direction of force along unit vector ($(\vec{r}-\vec{r^{'}})$)
