# Some Basic Concepts of chemistry
## Chemistry 
- It deals with Preparation, properties, composition, reactions, and structure of materials.
- In ancient India chemistry called as Rasayan shastra, Rastantra, Rasvidya/Ras kriya.

- Kautilya's Arthashastra -> production of salt and types of Liquors.
- Rasopanishad -> Preparation of gunpowder.
- Rasnavam -> uses of various furnaces, ovens.
- Chakrapani -> discovered mercury sulphide, credit of inventing soap(mix. of mustard oil and some alkalies.)
- Varahmihir's Brihat Samhita -> perfumes and Cosmetics.
- Gandhayukli -> recipes of scents, mouth perfume.
- Kashyap (Acharya Kanda) -> first proponent of 'atomic theory'.
- Nanotechnology : Extreme reduction of particle size.
- Matter : anything that occupy space and has mass.
- Its Classification :
	- Matter
		- Mixture
			- Homogeneous, it is uniform composition
			- Heterogeneous, it is non-uniform composition
		- Pure substance
			- Element, mixture of same types of atoms.
			- Compound, mixture of same types of molecules.
- constituents of compounds can be separated by chemical method.
- Properties of substance
	- Physical properties
		- like colour, odour, melting point, boiling point, density, etc.
	- Chemical properties
		- like composition, combustibility, reactivity with acids and bases, etc.
- Mass 
	- amount of matter present in it.
	- SI unit -> kg.
- Weight
	- Force exerted by gravity on an object.
- Volume :
	- amount of space occupied by a substance.

- Laws of Chemical Combinations :
	- Law of Conservation of Mass,
		- Mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.
	- Law of definite proportions/Compositions,
		- A given compound always contain exactly same proportions of elements by weight,
		- example : water of pond, river, oceans, contains in 2:1 of H2O.
	- Law of multiple proportions,
		- if two elements combine to form more than one compound, then masses of element (combine with one fixed mass of element )are in ratio of small whole number
	- Gay's law of gaseous volumes,
		- when gases combine they bears simple ratio at constant temperature and volume
		- example : H(100 ml) + O(50 ml) -> water(100 ml)
	- Avogadro's law
		- equal volumes of all gases at same temperature and pressure, should contain equal number of molecules.
		- it made distinctions between atoms and molecules.
- Dalton's Atomic theory :
	- In 1808, a new system of chemical philosophy -
	- Matter consist of indivisible atoms.
	- all atoms of a given element have identical properties, and identical mass. atoms of different elements differ in mass.
	- Compounds are formed when atoms of different elements combine in a fixed ratio.
	- chemical reaction involve recombination of atoms ( they are neither crated nor destroyed in a chemical reaction )
- Atomic and Molecular Masses
