## How to find no of degree of freedom(generalized co-ordinates)?


If a rigid body is placed in $3D$ space, 
For Describing $3D$ a [[Rigid body]], you have to take four arbitrary points in the body 
For $2D$ rigid body , we required at least three points.
For $1D$ rigid Body , we required at least two points. 
For $0D$  rigid body , we required at lest one points as shown in fig

No of generalized co-ordinate for $3D,2D,1D ~and~0D$ object is six $(x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2,z_1)$, six $(x_1,x_2,x_3,y_1,y_2,z_1)$, five $(x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2,z_1)$ and three $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ respectively .
