# Wave motion and wave on a string
## [[Wave]]
- Types of Wave
	1. waves on basis of particle / without particle oscillation,
		- Mechanical Waves
			- like sound, water, string wave
			- requires medium
		- E.M. wave / Non-Mechanical Wave
			- doesn't require medium
	1. waves on basis of oscillation of particle and direction propagation of wave,
		- Transverse Wave :
			- if oscillates in perpendicular wave velocity
			- example : water, em wave, etc.
		- Longitudinal Wave :
			- if oscillates parallel to wave velocity.
			- example sound wave .
- Interference of waves when meeting at a point having phase difference delta.

- Types of Interference of waves
	- Phase difference of two interference of wave : **Δδ = 2π(Δx) / λ**
	- Constructive Interference
		- if (phase difference) Δδ = 0, 2π, 4π, ... ( 2 n )π 
		- or Δx = nλ
	- Destructive Interference
		- if (phase difference) Δδ = π, 3π, 5π, ... ( 2 n + 1 )π 
		- or Δx = (2 n + 1) λ / 2
	- Intensity after Interference of two waves,
		- $I=(|R|)^2=(|A|)^2+(|B|)^2+2(|A|)(|B|)Cos(\delta)$ 
		
		 If $(|A|)=(|B|) ~then,$
		
		- $I=4A^2Cos(\frac{\delta}{2})^2$
