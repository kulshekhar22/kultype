# Wave
$y=A f(x-vt)$  is wave going in the x- direction with velocity $v$.

 Differential equation of wave is given below

$(\frac{d^2y}{dx^2})_{constant~t} = \frac{1}{v^2}(\frac{d^2y}{dt^2})_{constant~x}$  is general equation of wave having velocity $v$.

For a EM wave , 
$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$, $\vec{p}=\hbar\vec{k}$
For Photon,
$E =h\nu=\frac{h}{2\pi}2\pi\nu=\hbar\omega$
