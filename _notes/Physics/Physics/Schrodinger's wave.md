# Schrodinger's Wave
If a particle behaves like wave, then which physical quantity changing with time and position?
Let us suppose that quantity is denoted by $\psi(x)$ and given by equation 

$\psi(x)=Ae^{i(kx-wt)}$ , for no interaction, $E=K.E=\frac{p^2}{2m}~and~p=\hbar k$   
So above equation is written as
$$\psi(x)=Ae^{i(\frac{p}{\hbar}x-\frac{E}{\hbar}t)}$$
we want it in general form, same as [[Wave]] equation which is denoted by differential equation
The general wave function for particle behaving like wave is Schrodinger's equation and given by  
$$-\frac{(\hbar)^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial t^2} +V(x)\psi=i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}$$
Above equation tells how is $\psi$ is changing with time.
