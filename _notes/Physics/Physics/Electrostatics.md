# Electrostatics
**Electrostatics** : study about static or rest charges.
- **Charge** : A fundamental property of a matter.
	- they are quantized and in Integral multiples of 1charge.
	- Attraction or Repulsion
	- Its Formation :
		- by Rubbing
		- by Induction
	- **Mass** : If a mass have velocity its mass changes relatively. but charge not behave like mass. 
	- by ![[Mass changes relativey by .excalidraw]]
- [[Coulomb's Law]]   [[Coulomb's Law .excalidraw | with Figure]]
- Electric Field
	- It is defined as Electric force per unit charge$$\vec{E(\vec{r})}=\frac{\vec{F(\vec{r})}}{q}$$
	- If a charge Q is placed at $\vec{r'}$ then Electric Field ![[Drawing 2022-08-12 08.28.28.Electric Field_excalidraw| Electric Field ]] at $\vec{r}$ is given by $$\vec{E(\vec{r})}=\frac{\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Qq}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r^{'}}|^{3}}(\vec{r}-\vec{r^{'}})}{q}$$ $$\vec{E(\vec{r})}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{Q}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r^{'}}|^{3}}(\vec{r}-\vec{r^{'}})$$
	- Net Electric Field at a point due to various Charges                                
       ($Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4........Q_n$) is given by sum of all Electric fields $$\vec{E_{net}(\vec{r})}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \vec{E_i(\vec{r})}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{Q_i}{|\vec{r}-\vec{r_i^{'}}|^{3}}(\vec{r}-\vec{r_i^{'}})$$ ^b3eea6
- Electric Field Due to Various Charge Distribution
	- Discrete Charge distribution
		- ![[Electrostatics#^b3eea6| Net Field Due to Various Charges Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4........Q_n.]]
	- Continuous Charge distribution
