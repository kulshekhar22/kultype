# Significant fig.
Measurement scale should be decided first, Lea.st count for the same scale.
All undoubtful and one doubtful digits are significant.
Let us take a Cm scale( L.C = 0.1cm) which is found in your school bag. Measure the length of pen (natural length of pen is 4.55 cm) , you probably put one end of pen at zero of the scale and read 4.54, 4.55, 4.56 here last digit 4, 5, 6 respectively is measured by eye estimation that's why this digit is called doubtful digit and 4.5 is undoubtful measured without eye estimation.
