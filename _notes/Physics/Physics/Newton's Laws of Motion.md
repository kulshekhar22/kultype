# Newton's Laws of Motion

## 1st Law
> [! First Law states that,]
> If Net External [[Force]] = Zero, then acceleration = Zero (a = 0, means v=0 or v=constant)

> [! Frame of reference]
> - Inertial Frame :
> Frame in which First Law is valid is called Inertial Frame.
> OR Frame having a = 0.
> 
> - Non-Intertial Frame :
> Frame in which First Law is not valid is called Non-Inertial Frame.
> OR Frame having  'a' not= 0.

## 2nd Law
> [! Net External Force = ma, (where m -> mass and a -> acceleration ) ]
> - only valid in Inertial Frame.

## 3rd Law
> [! Action and  Reaction forces are equal and opposite in direction ]
