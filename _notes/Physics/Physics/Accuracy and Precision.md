# Accuracy and Precision

>[!Accuracy]
>If the difference between natural value and observed value is least , then it is called most accurate.
 Suppose, a rod has natural length $l= 2.45 cm$ and following are the observed value by different students
 $2.4cm,2.5cm,2.44cm,2.55cm,2.461cm$ , then most accurate value is $2.44cm$ .



>[!Precision]
If observed value is more precise then the measured value has more (Decimal place) precision or all measured value are all most same  . 
suppose, A rod is measured by different students and students got different result as follows

| Name of students | Observed Length(cm) |     |     |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | --- | --- |
| A                | 2.456               |     |     |
| B                | 1.64532             |     |     |
| C                | 2.9                 |     |     |
| D                | 122.23              |     |     |
 
 
 Student has found the length of rod = 1.64532 cm,  which has five place after decimal.
