# Introduction
It is a kind of [[Mathematical Physics/Periodic Motion]], specially oscillatory motion .
The oscillatory motion in which force is directly proportional to displacement and force and displacement both are in opposite direction all through out the motion.
Mathematically we write it as 
$$\vec{F}=-k\vec{x}$$
Where $k$ is proportionality constant.
