# Realistic Wave Function

![[Drawing 2022-07-31 08.58.10.realistic wave functionexcalidraw]]
$$\psi(x) = \delta(x-x_0)$$
It has pure state for position(single position, zero momentum) and mixed state for momentum(infinite no of momentum)

$$\psi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} e^{ik_ox}$$
Above [[Wave]] equation has single wavelength means pure state for momentum, and has infinite position means mixed state for position.
