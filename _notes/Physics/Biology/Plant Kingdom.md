# Plant Kingdom
- found in terrestrial and aquatic habitats, 
- eukaryotic, multicellular
- unicellular forms (like chlorella)
- Its classification according to A.W.Eichler
	- Cryptogamae
		- flowerless, seedless, spore bringing plants
		- example, ferns, liches, algae
		- its types :
			- Thallophyta
			- Bryophyta
			- Pteridophyta
	- Phanerogamae
		- flower bearing
		- seed producing 
		- example: mango, banyan dicot
		- its types :
			- Gymospermae
			- Angiospermae
- Its Types :
	- Algae
		- it is chlorophyll-bearing, simple, thalloid, autotrophic and largely aquatic organisms.
		- useful, being photosynthetic.
		- increase level of oxygen in environment.
		- chlorela a unicellular algae rich in proteins used as food even by space travellers.
		-  They reproduce,
			- vegetatively, by fragmentation, each fragment develops into thallus (plant body of algae. )
			- asexually, by production of different types of spores. most common is zoospores
			- sexually, by fusion of two gametes. it can be 1. flagellated and similar in size 2. Non-flagellated and similar in size. This type of reproduction called isogamous.
			- fusion of two dissimilar gametes called anisogamous.
			- fusion of (large, non-motile, female) with (smaller, motile, male) called oogamous
		- Its types :
			- Chlorophyceae (green algae)
				- unicellular, colonial or filamentous
				- green due to dominance of chlorophyll a and b.
				- most have one or more storage bodies called Pyrenoids(it contain proteins.)
				- some store food in oil droplets form.
				- rigid cell wall.
				- Reproduce :
					- vegetatively -> fragmentation/spore formation
					- asexually -> flagellated zoospores
					- sexually -> isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous.
				- example : volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and chara, Euglena.
				- source of food(high ammount of protein and vitamins).
				- used in seawage treatment plants.
				- fix atmospheric nitrogen.
			- Phaeophyceae(Brown algae)
				- found in marine habitat
				- possess chlorophyll-a and -c
				- vary in colour from olive green to various shades of brown (depend upon pigment).
				- food stored as complex carbohydrates in laminarin or mannitol form.
				- vegetative cells are covered by coating of algin.
				- plant bodies attached to substratum by a holdfast. 
				- has a stalk, the stipe. 
				- leaf like photosynthetic organ the frond.
				- reproduction:
					- vegetatively -> fragmentation 
					- asexually -> biflagellate zoospores
					- sexually -> isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Union of gametes may takes place in water. 
				- example : Ectocarpus, Dictyota, Laminaria and fucus.
			- Rodophyceae (Red algae)
				- multicellular and complex life cycle.
				- predominance of red pigment, chlorophyll-a and -d, r-phycoerythrin.
				- found in Marine, and warmer areas.
				- food stored as floridean starch(similar to glycogen in structure)
				- vegetatively -> fragmentation
				- asexually -> non-motile spores
				- sexually -> non-motile gametes(it is oogamous).
				- example : polysiphonia, porphyra, Gracilaria and Gelidium.
				- source of agar-agar(a good culture medium)
				- used as food in soups, also as medicine, in polish as paints, also in cosmotics.
	- Bryophytes
		- also called amphibians of plant kingdom because they need water for sexual reproduction.
		- found in humid and shaded localities, moist area of hill.
