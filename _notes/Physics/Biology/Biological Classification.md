# Biological Classification 
1. First proposed by Aristotle, based on morphological characters.
1. Two Kingdom system : oldest system given by Linnaeus.
	- having two kingdom
		1. Plantae
		2. Animalia

1. Five Kingdom Classification : give by R.H. Whittaker
	1. Kingdom Monera, 
		-  monera example : Blue Green bacteria
		- bacteria group in four categories on the basis of shape : 
			- Spherical Coccus -- cocci
			- rod-shaped Bacillus -- bacilli
			- comma-shaped Vibrium -- vibrio
			- spiral Spirillum -- spirilla
		1. Archaebacteria :
			1. halophiles - in salty areas. example : Halococcus, Halobacterium.
			2. thermoacidophiles - hot and acidic water. example : Thermoplasma, Thermoproteus, Sulfolobus.
			3. methanogens - marshy areas (responsible -> production of methane(biogas) from animal waste ).
		2. Eubacteria or true bacteria :
			- having rigid cell wall
			- reproduce by fission, in unfavourable conditions produce spores, sexually by transfer of primitive type of DNA.
			- on the basis of nutrition : they are of three types 
			1. Photosynthetic autotrophs
				- cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) havign chlorophyll as green plants.
			2. Chemosynthetic autotrophs 
				1. help fix atmospheric nitrogen (example : Nostoc and Anabaena) and other nutrients
			3. Heterotrophic bacteria
				- some are decomposers, help making curd, fix nitrogen, are pathogens.
		- Mycoplasma : 
			- lack of cell wall 
			- smallest living cell 
			- survive without oxygen.
			- saprotrophs
			- pathogenic in animals and plants
	1. Kingdom Protista, 
		-  example : pseudopodia (Amoeba), flagella (Leishmania)
		1. Chrysophytes :
			- example : Diatoms and golden algae(desmids), found in fresh water and in marine environment.
			- in Diatoms cell wall -> two thin overlapping shells -> embedded with Silica.
		2. Dinoflagellates
			- Mostly marine and photosynthetic.
			- appears yellow, green, brown, blue or red according to pigment
			- most have two flagella.
				- one longitudinally and other transversely.
			- red dinoflagellates -> like Gonyaulax(makes sea red. by rapid reproduction.)
		1. Euglenoids
			- Instead of cell wall they have pellicle(makes body flexible)
			- having two flagella, one short and other long.
			- in presence sunglight -> Autotrophs.
			- in absence of sunlight -> Hetrotrophs.
			- example : Euglena.
		2. Slime Moulds
			- Sprophytic protists
			- in favourable conditions, they form aggregates called plasmodium.
			- in unfavourable conditions , forms spores.
			- Reproduce ,
				- by fragmentation 
				- by formation of sporangia
				- sexually (by fusion of gametes)
		1. Protozoans
			- Heterotrophs and live as prdators/parasites
			- colourless
			- reproduce, 
				- sexually :
					- by conjugation/syngamy
				- asexually :
					- budding
					- fission 
			- its major groups : 
				-  Amoeboid protozoans :
					- live in fresh water catch prey by pseudopodia.
				- Flagellated protozoans
					- either free-living or parasitic
					- have flagella
					- example : Trypanosoma(cause sleeping sickness)
				- Ciliated protozoans
					- Aquatic
					- having thousands of cilia
					- example : Paramoecium
				- Sporozoans
					- organisms having infectious spore-like stage
					- example Plasmodium(malarial parasite causing, malaria)
	1. Kingdom Fungi
		- Study of Fungi called Mycology.
		- they are Heterotrophic, saprophytes, parasites, some grown in association with algae to form Lichens , some grow with roots of higher plants called Mycorrhiza.
		- They are filamentous except yeast.
		- Mycelium -> network of hyphae(long slender thread like structure.)
		1. Phycomycetes :
			- found in aquatic habitats, decaying wood, or as obligate parasites on plants.
			- Reproduce asexually by, Zoospores(motile ) or by aplanospores(non-motile).
			- example : Mucor, Rhizopus and Albugo(parasitic fungi on mustard)
		2. Ascomycetes
			- also known -> sac-fungi
			- Main feature -> Absence of motile(represented by + ) structure.
			- mostly are multicellular example : Penicillium, Black mold (Aspergillus).
			- thallus is highly developed, branched with septate mycelium.
			- fungi produce -> endogenous meiospores called Ascospores
			- Ascospores are sexual spores, it is sac like structures.
			- example : Aspergillus, Neurospora, Yeast.
			- many are edible like : morels and truffles.
			- reproduce : 
				- vegetatively : fragmentation of mycelium
				- asexually : budding, fission of formation of Conidia.
				- sexually : fusion of gametes followed by meiosis result in haploid ascus.
			- their beneficial activity :
				-  used in bakery, manufacturing organic acids, vitamins
				- some are edible and delicious.
			- their harmful activity :
				- cause diseases like Powdery Mildew of grapes
				- in man : Athlete's foot
				- some spoil foods.
		1. Basidiomycetes
			- The club fungi, because club shape of mycelium known as basidium.
			- This class of fungi known as mushrooms, puff balls(also called clavatia, contains an anti-cancer substance), rusts, smuts(saprophytic species).
			- grows in soil, on logs, tree stumps, in living plant bodies example : (rusts and smuts) most dangerous parasites of food crops.
			- Best decomposers of wood material like cellulose
			- life cycle passes through,
				- Monokaryotic phase(Secondary mycelium) -> short phase
				- Dikaryotic phase(Secondary mycelium) -> long phase, each cell have +ve and -ve nuclei.
			- Reproduce in stages,
				- Plasmogamy
				- Karyogamy
				- meiosis
			- form fruiting bodies called basidiocarps.
			- Example : Agaricus, Bracket fungi, Ustilago, etc.
		1. Deuteromycetes 
			- Imperfect fungi, because only asexual/vegetative phase is known.
			- They reproduce only by asexual spores called conidia.
			- the mycelium is septate and branched
			- example : Alternaria, Trichoderma.
	1. [[Plant Kingdom]] Kingdom Plantae : 
		- They are multicellular, eukaryotic, cell wall
		- heterotrophs but some are insectivorous (like venus fly trap) /parasites (like Cuscuta).
		- Plantae(like, algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms).
		- store food in form starch.
		- Life cycle of plants :
			- diploid sporophytic phase.
			- haploid gametophytic phase.
		- 'Alteration of generation' A type of life cycle in which subsequent generation of plants alternate between Diploid and Haploid organisms.
	1. [[Animal Kingdom]] Kingdom Animalia
		- Multicellular, Eukaryotic, without cell wall and chlorophyll.
		- They are mobile(movable), due to contraction and relaxation of muscles.
		- reserved food in the form of Glycogen or fat.
	2. Viruses, Viroids, Prions and Lichens :
		1. Viruses :
			- Non-cellular organisms
			- characterise by inert crystalline (consist of proteins) structure outside the living cell.
			- cause diseases like,mumps, small pox,herpes, AIDS, leaf rolling and curling.
		2. Viroids
			- new infectious agent found by T.O.Diener
			- smaller than virus
			- lack of protein coat which is found in virus.
		3. Prions
			- similar to size of virus.
			- its diseases 
				- bovine spongiform encephalopathy(BSE) also called mad cow disease.
				- Cr-Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.
		1. Lichens
			- good pollution indicator.
			- mutually useful association between algae and fungi.
			- algal component known as phycobiont 
			- fungal component known as mycobiont.
