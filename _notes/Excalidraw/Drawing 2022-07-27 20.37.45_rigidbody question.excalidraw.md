# Text Elements
1. A point particle is moving on surface of sphere, find generalized co ordinate for particle.
 
2. A rigid body with one point fixed is placed in 3D space , find degree of freedom of rigid body

3. A 2D rigid body is moving in 2D space, fin generalized co ordinate for this rigid body.

4. Find the degree of freedom of 3D rigid body which is moving in nD space.    ^3ljuSuow
